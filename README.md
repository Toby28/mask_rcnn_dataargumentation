# Mask R-CNN for Object Detection and Segmentation

This is a modified version of Mask R-CNN for object detection and instance segmentation on Keras and TensorFlow (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN.git). It is modified to detect the worker pose in construction site. 

We provide 3 levels, 5 kinds of data in this repository.
level-0: the real data, collected from the real construction scence.
